How often you forgot water a home plants? I usually :)

And I tried to resolve this problem. No, I haven't been creating a reminds! I created an <b>autowatering</b>!

It needs Raspberry Pi, soil moisture sensor module and water pomp

It works!

Just download this, connect sensors to current GPIO and run!
