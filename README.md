How often do you forget water a home plants? I do it usually :)

And I tried to solve this problem. No, I haven't created a reminds! I created an <b>autowatering</b>!

It needs Raspberry Pi, soil moisture sensor module and water pomp

It works!

Just download this, connect sensors to proper GPIO and run!
